<li>"Nim" is an ancient two-player game played with sticks or stones. The objects are divided into piles.</li>
<li>The players alternate turns.</li>
<li>On each player's turn they may remove any number of sticks from one of the piles, up to the number of sticks remaining in that pile; but they can only take from a single pile on a given turn.</li>
<li>The goal is to take the last stick, making you the winner.</li>
<li>The strategy element is to make the other person clear out all but one pile, so you can take all the sticks in that last pile.</li>

<li>Unavoidable or unforeseeable circumstances causing the situation to change after decisions have been made. This is common in Text adventures</li>
<li><i>Zugzwang</i>, as in chess, when any move a player chooses makes him worse off than before but the rules of chess means they have to move.</li>
<li>A situation in which the player has to accomplish two mutually dependent tasks each of which must be completed before the other or that are mutually exclusive (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)">a Catch-22</a>).</li>
